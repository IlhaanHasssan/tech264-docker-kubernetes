## ***Differences between Virtualization and Containerization***
| Feature               | Virtualization                                       | Containerization                                 |
|-----------------------|------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation**         | Each VM has a full OS and is isolated from others    | Containers share the host OS but have isolated environments |
| **Efficiency**        | Higher resource usage due to multiple OS instances   | More efficient, lightweight; shares OS kernel    |
| **Startup Speed**     | Slower to start, as it boots an OS                   | Starts quickly, as it runs from host OS          |
| **Portability**       | Typically less portable due to OS dependencies       | Highly portable across different environments    |
| **Use Cases**         | Useful for running different OS environments         | Ideal for lightweight applications and microservices |

### ***What is Included in a Container vs Virtual Machine***

| Aspect                     | Container                                      | Virtual Machine                      |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------|
| **OS Kernel**              | Shared with host                               | Separate OS per VM                   |
| **Application Code & Binaries** | Included                                | Included                             |
| **Libraries & Dependencies**   | Included                                   | Included                             |
| **Hypervisor**             | Not required                                   | Required                             |
| **Overhead**               | Minimal                                        | Higher                               |

### ***Benefits of Each, Especially Virtual Machine Over Traditional Architecture***

| Benefit                    | Virtual Machine                           | Container                                |
|----------------------------|------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Isolation**              | Strong isolation due to separate OS       | Lightweight, less strict isolation       | 
| **Resource Allocation**    | Dedicated resources per VM               | Shares resources more efficiently        |

- **Traditional Architecture**  
  VMs offer better security, hardware emulation, and are suitable for monolithic applications on traditional infrastructure. Containers, by contrast, excel in agility, speed, and are more suited for cloud-native or microservices-based architectures.

## ***Microservices***

- **What Are They?**  
  Microservices are a design pattern for building an application as a collection of small, loosely coupled services, each responsible for a specific functionality.

- **How Are They Made Possible?**  
  Enabled by containerization and orchestration tools like Docker and Kubernetes, which allow isolated, independently deployable components.

- **Benefits**  
  - **Scalability:** Each service scales independently.
  - **Flexibility:** Easier to deploy, update, and maintain.
  - **Resilience:** Failure in one service doesnâ€™t bring down the entire system.

## ***Docker***

- **What Is It?**  
  Docker is an open-source platform designed to simplify application deployment using containers.

- **Alternatives**  
  - Podman
  - LXC (Linux Containers)
  - rkt (Rocket)
  - OpenVZ

- **How It Works (Docker Architecture/API)**  
  Docker uses a client-server architecture, with the Docker Client communicating with the Docker Daemon to manage containers. The Daemon handles container lifecycle, resource allocation, and API requests.

- **Success Story Using Docker**  
  Companies like Netflix, Spotify, and PayPal use Docker to scale microservices, reduce deployment times, and increase application efficiency.

## ***Docker Commands***
- Make sure you run your git bash window as administrator
- `docker --help`
- `docker run hello-world` produces a randomly named container 
- `docker ps` shows which processes are running
- ` docker run -d -p 80:80 nginx` automatically downloads the latest nginx version
- `docker ps --help`
- `docker ps -a`
- `docker rm <container-name>`
- `docker exec` executes commands
